# Nasa-Images (work in progress)

Purpose of the project:
1) Practice and improve my skills in Java development and automation testing.
2) Show my understanding of how a company software product works (backend, testing, logging - for outside of code debugging purposes) and working with Git.
3) Recover unique space related images (Astronomy picture of the day, Earth polychromatic pictues, Images from Mars, etc') using the Nasa API.
4) Have fun!

Demo: Use the NasaAPI/src/main/java/Main.java class to run a demo of the available API's.
Configure the parameters (in particular, the path the images are saved to) and run the main class.
Note - There might be some problems when running all the methods due to the restriction of API usage in a short span of time, therefore, use only three at a time (simply comment one out). Will be resolved later.

Automation:
To run the automation, simply run the FullAutomation/UnitTests/IntegrationTests classes.
Note - There might be some problems when running all the tests due to the restriction of API usage in a short span of time, therefore, tests might get stuck.
Will be resolved later.
